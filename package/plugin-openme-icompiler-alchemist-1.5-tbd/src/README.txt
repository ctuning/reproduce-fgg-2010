************************************************************************
Alchemist plugin is used to convert any compiler into interactive research environment
to support various Collective Mind research ideas particularly for
collaborative program/architecture auto-tuning, run-time adaptation, machine learning 
and crowdsourcing for multiple objectives including performance, code size, compilation 
time, power consumptions and other characteristics:

* extraction and subtitution of passes
* extraction of code structure (patterns)
* reactions to code modifications (possibly semantically non-equivalent)

 This plugin should be compiled WITHOUT ANY -O optimization 
 otherwise the behavior is unpredictable.
